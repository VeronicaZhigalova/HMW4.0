# This project is a homework assignment with 6 main tasks and 5 additional ones.
# Main tasks
1. Return a new character in which the character at index n has been removed.
2. Two integers, return their sum. If two values are equal, return twice the sum of those numbers.
3. Given three integers, return the largest one.
4. Given an integer n, return true if it is within 10 units of 100 or 200.
5. Given a string, return a new string with "not" appended to the beginning. However, if the string already starts with "not", return the string unchanged.
6. Write a method that takes an integer and checks whether it is even. If the number is even, return true, otherwise return false.

# Extra tasks
1. Given 2 int values, return true if either of them is in the range 10..20 inclusive.
2. Given two temperatures, return true if one is less than 0 and the other is greater than 100.
3. You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write code to compute the result, encoded as an int value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, 2=big ticket. If the speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2. Unless it is your birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.
4. Given a string str, if the string starts with "f" return "Fizz". If the string ends with "b" return "Buzz". If both the "f" and "b" conditions are true, return "FizzBuzz". In all other cases, return the string unchanged.
5. Given three ints, a b c, return true if one of b or c is "close" (differing from a by at most 1), while the other is "far", differing from both other values by 2 or more. Note: Math.abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number.
